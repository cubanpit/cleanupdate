# cleanupdate

Simple script to update and clean an Arch-based system.

The script can switch between Italian and English languages.

(At the moment it hasn't very elegant code, it's a work in progress.)

### Features:

 - update packages from repositories;
 - update packages from AUR (`pacaur` or `yaourt`);
 - search and uninstall orphaned packages;
 - clean pacman cache;
 - optimize (defragment) pacman database;
 - clean temporary or unuseful files;

Further details are available within the script documentation page, in Italian or English.
